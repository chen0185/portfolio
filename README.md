# portfolio
I used the personal website design of the ux course as the basis, combined with bootstrap to write my website, the website pages are home page, portfolio page, about me, contact four pages, showing the design concept on the home page, on the portfolio The page shows some of my products over the past eight months, and the aboutme page shows my educational background, work experience and volunteer experience. On the contact page, clients can leave a message to my studio. In the process of programming this website, I encountered the original UX design mark, how to display in the program, as well as the layout of the page, and the size of the picture to fit the screen, etc., have been adjusted and written accordingly. I ended up with a website with a simple and clear layout that fully expresses the characteristics of the studio.
The header part of my homepage, the social icon part, and the product display part of the portfolio page are all modified from the template downloaded from the bootstrap website. The source is bootstrap-5.2.0examples.
